# Plane-Crashes-Analysis
This repository contains analysis and visuals done by SQL and Tableau of the data from Kaggle containing information of Plane Crashes throughout history. The analyis/visualizations aims to answer key questions such as:
  - What were the top 10 operators involved in crashes?
  - Where did the most crashes happen?
  - What year did the most fatalities occur?
  - What were the survival rates throughout the years?

With these questions answered, this project will offer analysis that can show which operators are most prone to have an accident for frequent travelers.
